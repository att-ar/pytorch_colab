# SOC Estimation Using PyTorch and Pandas
The repo that [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/att-ar/pytorch_colab/blob/main/LSTM-Model.ipynb#scrollTo=7cff22a7) will reference.<br>
This repo will contain the neural network that will be run and hosted on Google Colab.
At least until a final network is decided upon.
